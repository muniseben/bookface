# Bookface (12-15 December 2022)

>  ## Mission objectives


The idea: When someone registers to the app, they can create a "Profile", then they can go to what I will call, their "floors", wich is a place where a user can post what they think, what they do, maybe a picture of them...

Then, they can use the space bar, to search for other persons using Bookface and check out what they posted on their floors.

> ## Completed
- Being able to sign in, sign up, and go to dashboard.
- Used mongoDB Atlas.
- Good file structure.
